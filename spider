            <h3>Film Review -Spider-Man: Across the SpiderVerse- </h3>
            <img src="spider.jpg" alt="Blog gönderisi resmi">
            <p>In 2018, Sony Pictures Animation jumped into the superhero blockbuster realm with the release of the
                animated feature Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse. Directed by Bob Persichetti, Peter Ramsey, Rodney
                Rothman, the movie, which starred the voices of Shameik Moore, Jake Johnston, Hailee Steinfeld,
                Mahershala Ali, Brian Tyree Henry, Nicolas Cage, and Liev Schreiber, follows young high school teen
                Miles Morales, who becomes the new Spider-Man in his world and becomes entangled in a large multiverse
                threat by teaming up with other Spider-people from parallel universes. Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse
                was theatrically released on December 14th, 2018 and receive widespread critical acclaim from both
                critics and moviegoers, who praise the feature for its animation, characters, humor, story, and voice
                acting. The movie also went on to gross over $384 million at the box office against its $90 million
                production budget. In addition, the film also gained momentum at the awards season by winning the Best
                Animated Feature at the 91st Academy Awards (being the first non-Disney / Pixar release to win the award
                since 2011’s Rango) as well as winning awards at the 76th Golden Globe Awards, the 46th Annie Awards,
                and the 72nd British Academy Film Awards respectfully. Given the amount of success and praise that this
                movie received (even before its theatrical release), a sequel was immediately greenlit by Sony. Now,
                after five years since its release, Sony Pictures Animation and directors Joaquim Dos Santos, Kemp
                Powers, and Justin K. Thompson prepare to jump back into the “Spider-Verse” with the release of
                Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse. Does this highly anticipated next chapter deliver on the high
                standards set by its predecessor or has the inherit hype for this spider-man project overshadows a
                middling second installment?</p>
            <p>Across the Spider-Verse is an amazing and visually stunning animated film that takes what was previously
                done in predecessor and improves upon it. Don’t get me wrong, there was nothing wrong about the
                animation found in Into the Spider-Verse as it was way above the standard CGI endeavors from some of the
                major cartoon studios, but also had its own unique style and approach towards comic book source
                material. For this sequel, the movie’s animation continues that trend, but also gives way to new
                dynamics towards that particular style, which translates into an improved and celebratory animated
                feature that’s quite compelling by just sheer for it’s animated style. Taking what was previously
                learned, the animators give each scene and sequence in Across the Spider-Verse have wonderful and visual
                style that closes resembles a comic book portrayal, yet also imbues and interjects new usage of colors
                backgrounds and a slightly better understanding of fluid body movement, which makes for the action much
                more vibrant and exciting. Of course, with such a large narrative to cover within the discovery of the
                multiverse, Across the Spider-Verse’s visual style expands by showcasing new setting and places to
                display, especially the India-inspired city for New York City appropriately named “Mumbahattan” and the
                vast landscape of the where the Spider Society calls home from Miguel O’Hara’s universe. Thus, I do have
                to mention the film’s “behind the scenes” players, including Patrick O’Keefe (production designs), Dean
                Gordon and Araiz Khalid (art direction), Brooklyn El-Omar (costume designs), and the entire animator
                department team, for their valiant and spectacular efforts made on this project, which helps elevate the
                feature’s animation to new cinematic cartoon heights. In addition, the direction for the movie also
                gives way to some incredible and awe-inspiring cinematic shots that continue to build upon some great
                dynamics for Across the Spider-Verse. Lastly, the score, which was composed by Daniel Pemberton, is
                fantastic throughout the entire feature and definitely brings the superhero aesthetics within this
                composition of bombastic action and quieter dialogue driven moments.

            <h3>FINAL THOUGHTS</h3>
            <p>While still trying to balance his personal life with his superhero duties, Miles Morales gets entangled
                in a new web of confusion and revelations as he confronts a multiverse host of Spider-People from
                alternative realities and tries to thwart the efforts from a new enemy in the movie Spider-Man: Across
                the Universe. Directors Joaquim Dos Santos, Kemp Powers, and Justin K. Thompson’s latest film takes what
                was previously established in the popular 2018 animated feature and expands upon that narrative,
                exploring new universes, realities, and a compelling story of a young hero challenging the status quo of
                cannon sequences of events. While there are a few minor nitpicks that I have with the feature’s pacing
                and some elongated moments, the movie itself is visually stunning animated masterpieces, with special
                thanks to the feature’s trio of directors, an impressive style of presentation, meaningful and thematic
                morals, a terrific score, humorous bits, an intriguing story, interesting dynamics amongst characters
                (old and new), and talented voice cast across the board. Personally, I really liked this movie. It was
                an amazing sequel endeavor that both honored its first entry by expanding upon its narrative and
                character that was previously established, yet also used that particular platform to sprung off of for a
                bombastic and engaging story of multiverse mayhem and revelations. The animation was breathtaking
                (reaching new heights of visual flair) and the story, while only half of the story, was very interesting
                and engrossing towards its cliffhanger ending. Plus, the voice talents involved were great and provided
                a lot of humor and heart in their respective roles. I still think that the first one is slightly better
                (just a little bit more focused), but Across the Spider-Verse still has a lot of positives that Into the
                Spider-Verse did not have, which makes this sequel on the same level as its predecessor. Thus, my
                recommendation for this movie is quite an impressive “highly recommended”, especially if you were a fan
                of the first installment or just fan of Spider-Man character. It was definitely worth the wait and hype.
                It’s just that good. With this particular film completed, now the long wait begins for the release of
                Spider-Man; Beyond the Spider-Verse, which would be the second half of larger narrative that began in
                this film as well as also concluding this Spider-Verse trilogy. How will it end and tie everything
                together in a grand way? Only time will tell. For now, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is a
                fantastical follow-up to its 2018 animated adventure and delivers an incredible first half tale that
                truly is a visually stunning and spectacular “sequel” cannon event.</p>
